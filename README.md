# Setup
## Step 1: Finalize setup
- Run the `composer update` and `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Cleaning up by removing the `setup.php` file.

### Notes
- The existing plugin files were not formatted based on PHPCS standards, so I have formatted them.
- Also, some existing files have PHPCS standard errors are there, so I haven't fixed that. I have fixed the PHPCS errors within my code only.
